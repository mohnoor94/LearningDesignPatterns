# My Design Patterns Learning Journey

- I do learning-by-doing in this repo, and I make some violations on purpose like the weird package names just to make sure what is the sequence of the contents, so please do not judge me on this :)
- I use Java 11

## My Main Resources to Learn

* [Design Patterns in Java, Discover the modern implementation of design patterns with Java](https://www.udemy.com/design-patterns-java/).
    * Taught by [Dmitri Nesteruk](https://www.udemy.com/user/dmitrinesteruk/).
