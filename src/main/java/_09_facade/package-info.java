package _09_facade;

// Facade (Façade): Exposing several components through a single interface

// Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

// ====

// Summary:

// - Build a Façade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes.
// - May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the façade.
// - May allow users to 'escalate' to use more complex APIs if they need to.
