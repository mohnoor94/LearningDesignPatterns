// You are given a class called `Sentence`, which takes a string such as "hello world". You need to provide a method
// called `getWord()` that returns a `WordToken` which can be used to capitalize a particular word in the sentence.

// Typical use would be something like:
// var sentence = new Sentence("hello world");
// sentence.getWord(1).capitalize = true;
// System.out.println(sentence); // writes "hello WORLD";
