// Chain of Responsibility Coding Exercise

// You are given a game scenario with classes `Goblin` and `GoblinKing`. Please implement the following rules:
// - A goblin has base 1 attack/1 defense (1/1), a goblin king is 3/3.
// - When the Goblin King is in play, every other goblin gets +1 Attack.
// - Goblins get +1 to Defense for every other Goblin in play (a GoblinKing is a Goblin!).

// Example:
// - Suppose you have 3 ordinary goblins in play. Each one is a 1/3 (1/1 + 0/2 defense bonus).
// - A goblin king comes into play. Now every goblin is a 2/4 (1/1 + 0/3 defense bonus from each other + 1/0 from goblin king)

// The state of all the goblins has to be consistent as goblins are added and removed from the game.
