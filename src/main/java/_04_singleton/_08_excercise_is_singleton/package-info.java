package _04_singleton._08_excercise_is_singleton;

// Since implementing a singleton is easy, you have a different challenge:&nbsp;write a method called 'isSingleton()'.
// This method takes a factory method that returns an object and it's up to you to determine whether or not that
// object is a singleton instance.
