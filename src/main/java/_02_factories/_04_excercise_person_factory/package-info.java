package _02_factories._04_excercise_person_factory;

// You are given a class called Person.
// The person has two fields: id and name.
// Please implement a non-static PersonFactory that has a createPerson() method that takes a person's name
// and returns a new instance of Person.
// The id of the person returned should be set as a 0-based index of the object created by that factory.
// So, the first person the factory makes should have id=0, second id=1 and so on.
